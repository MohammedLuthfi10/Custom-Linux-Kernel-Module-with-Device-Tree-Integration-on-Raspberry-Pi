# Project 2: Custom Linux Kernel Module with Device Tree Integration on Raspberry Pi

## Description
This project focuses on **Linux kernel development** by creating a custom **character device driver** for the **Raspberry Pi**. The driver interfaces with **GPIO pins** and utilizes the **device tree** for automatic hardware configuration. It includes implementing synchronization mechanisms (mutexes and spinlocks) and creating device tree overlays for GPIO control.

## Project Goals
- Develop skills in **Linux kernel module** programming.
- Understand **device tree** integration for hardware configuration.
- Implement synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety in device drivers.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Set Up Development Environment
- Install **Ubuntu 18.04+** on a PC or virtual machine.
- Set up a cross-compilation environment for Raspberry Pi using `gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf`.
- Clone the **Raspberry Pi OS** repository from [Raspberry Pi OS GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux).
- Install required packages for kernel building (`make`, `git`, `dtc`).

### 2. Build and Configure Kernel
- Download the **Raspberry Pi kernel source code**.
- Configure the kernel for Raspberry Pi using `make bcm2709_defconfig`.
- Build the kernel and create an **SD card image** to boot the Raspberry Pi.

### 3. Create a Custom Character Device Driver
- Write a basic **character device driver** to control a GPIO pin.
- Use `copy_to_user` and `copy_from_user` functions for communication between user space and kernel space.
- Implement **open**, **read**, **write**, and **close** functions in the driver.

### 4. Integrate Device Tree
- Write a **device tree overlay** to configure GPIO pins and associate them with your driver.
- Load the overlay through `config.txt` and verify the GPIO pin functionality.
- Access device tree nodes from within your driver using `of_find_node_by_name()`.

### 5. Implement Synchronization Mechanisms
- Add **mutex locks** in the write function to ensure thread safety.
- Use **spinlocks** for high-priority sections to avoid race conditions.
- Test synchronization using concurrent read and write operations.

### 6. Testing and Debugging
- Compile and load the module onto the Raspberry Pi using `insmod` and `rmmod`.
- Use `dmesg` to check the logs and debug messages.
- Test the driver using `echo` and `cat` commands in `/dev/` to verify GPIO control.

### 7. Demonstration and Documentation
- Create a video showing how to load the module, interact with the GPIOs, and manage device tree overlays.
- Document the project on GitHub, detailing the device driver code, device tree overlay, and kernel compilation steps.

## Tools and Software Used
- **Ubuntu 18.04+** for development.
- **GCC cross-compiler** for ARM.
- **Raspberry Pi 4** for testing.
- **Device Tree Compiler (dtc)** for creating device tree overlays.
- **GitHub** for version control and documentation.
